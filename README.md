# Gerber_et_al_2022: scRNAseq Analysis of HSPCs in WT and PyMT mice


This github project contains the link to the raw data, the filtered data and the software to support the publication of Gerber et al. Within this repository you will find R scripts and data to analyse 10x scRNAseq experiments. We also provide supporting material including lists of differentially expressed genes and pathways. Any queries about the software or supporting documents can be made to Jason Cosgrove (jason.cosgrove@curie.fr)

In this study we wish to determine if breast cancer can impact on myeloid cell development in the bone marrow. For that purpose we are using the spontaneous breast cancer mouse model MMTV-PyMT. MMTV-PyMT is spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer. Genetically engineered female mice express the tumor oncogene PyMT under the MMTV promoter, leading to progressive (hyperplasia, adenoma, early and late carcinoma) tumor development in mammary glands. In the C57/Bl6 background, female developed palpable tumor around the age of 14w, and have a maximal tumor burden between the age of 18w to 25w old. To better understand the impact of cancer on hematopoiesis we have performed single cell RNA sequencing using the 10X genomics 3' platform on (L-S+K+) HSPCs on tumor bearing and tumor free mice.


  
 MMTV: mouse mammary tumor virus
 PyMT: Polyomavirus middle T antigen
